## tldr: immigrant, engineer, a lot of meta-questions

### Intro to online presence.

I'm a 21-yr-old Chinese-American immigrant and engineer studying Human-Centered Design Engineering at Stanford, an [individually designed major](https://ughb.stanford.edu/majors-minors/major-programs/individually-designed-major-engineering) in computer science and design thinking. I spend a lot of time thinking about how we might democratize meaningful work, develop more empathetic computer mediated interactions, and design empowering workflows for teams of diverse backgrounds.

### How I enjoy time.

I'm currently building [Pareto](www.hellopareto.com), a project management tool for the gig economy, and researching team status hierarchies at the [Stanford HCI Lab](https://hci.stanford.edu/). In another life, I designed games to facilitate vulnerable conversations about personal wellness at Stanford, built [chatbots](https://github.com/microsoft/lets-talk-mental-health) to destigmatize mental illness in India, and published [near-earth asteroid observations](https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/ECS/MPCArchive/2015/MPS_20150802.pdf) made in New Mexico. My favorite moments are spent exploring existential motivations for being, getting lost in [walking meditation](https://deerparkmonastery.org/), and making room to enjoy simplicity.
