### tldr: immigrant, engineer, HCI, future of work, has a lot of meta-questions

Hi there! Welcome to my online presence. I'm a 21-yr-old Chinese-American immigrant and engineer studying Human-Centered Design Engineering at Stanford (individually designed major, computer science and design thinking). I spend a lot of time thinking about how we might democratize meaningful work, develop more empathetic computer mediated interactions, and design empowering workflows for teams of diverse backgrounds. I'm currently building Pareto, a project management tool for the gig economy, and researching team status hierarchies at the Stanford HCI Lab. In another life, I designed games to facilitate vulnerable conversations about personal wellness at Stanford, built chatbots to destigmatize mental illness in India, and published near-earth asteroid observations made in New Mexico. My favorite moments are spent exploring existential motivations for being, getting lost in walking meditation, and making room to enjoy the simple things. Friends describe me as strong, wise, self-aware. My mother calls me a rule breaker.
